## Basic Strategies

### RSI Strategy

**Overview:**
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It identifies overbought and oversold conditions in the market.

**How It Works:**
- Calculates RSI using a 14-period default window
- Generates buy signals when RSI crosses below the oversold threshold (default: 30)
- Generates sell signals when RSI crosses above the overbought threshold (default: 70)
- Uses exponential moving averages for smoother calculations

**Parameters:**
- `rsi_period` (default: 14): Period for RSI calculation
- `overbought` (default: 70): Upper threshold for sell signals
- `oversold` (default: 30): Lower threshold for buy signals

**Pros:**
✅ Simple and easy to understand
✅ Works well in ranging markets
✅ Good for identifying reversal points
✅ Low computational requirements
✅ Effective risk management with clear entry/exit points

**Cons:**
❌ Can generate false signals in trending markets
❌ May miss strong trends due to early exits
❌ Requires parameter tuning for different assets
❌ Less effective in highly volatile markets

**Best Use Cases:**
- Sideways/ranging markets
- Assets with predictable support/resistance levels
- Medium to long-term trading (4H+ timeframes)
- Beginner traders learning technical analysis

**Implementation Example:**
```python
rsi_strategy = RSIStrategy(
    rsi_period=14,
    overbought=75,  # More conservative
    oversold=25     # More conservative
)
```

### MACD Strategy

**Overview:**
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) strategy uses the relationship between two moving averages to identify trend changes and momentum shifts.

**How It Works:**
- Calculates MACD line (12-period EMA - 26-period EMA)
- Calculates signal line (9-period EMA of MACD line)
- Generates buy signals when MACD crosses above signal line
- Generates sell signals when MACD crosses below signal line
- Uses histogram to show momentum strength

**Parameters:**
- `fast_period` (default: 12): Fast EMA period
- `slow_period` (default: 26): Slow EMA period
- `signal_period` (default: 9): Signal line EMA period

**Pros:**
✅ Excellent for trend identification
✅ Combines trend and momentum analysis
✅ Works well in trending markets
✅ Provides clear entry and exit signals
✅ Histogram shows momentum strength

**Cons:**
❌ Lagging indicator (signals come after trend starts)
❌ Can generate whipsaws in choppy markets
❌ Less effective in ranging markets
❌ May miss quick reversals

**Best Use Cases:**
- Strong trending markets
- Medium to long-term trading
- Cryptocurrency and forex markets
- Trend-following strategies

**Implementation Example:**
```python
macd_strategy = MACDStrategy(
    fast_period=8,   # Faster signals
    slow_period=21,  # Adjusted for crypto
    signal_period=5  # Quicker response
)
```

### EMA Crossover Strategy

**Overview:**
The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover strategy uses two EMAs of different periods to identify trend direction and generate trading signals.

**How It Works:**
- Calculates fast EMA (default: 9 periods) and slow EMA (default: 21 periods)
- Generates buy signals when fast EMA crosses above slow EMA
- Generates sell signals when fast EMA crosses below slow EMA
- Simple yet effective trend-following approach

**Parameters:**
- `fast_period` (default: 9): Fast EMA period
- `slow_period` (default: 21): Slow EMA period

**Pros:**
✅ Simple and intuitive
✅ Excellent trend identification
✅ Low computational overhead
✅ Works across multiple timeframes
✅ Good for beginners

**Cons:**
❌ Lagging signals
❌ Poor performance in ranging markets
❌ Can generate false signals during consolidation
❌ May enter trades late in trends

**Best Use Cases:**
- Clear trending markets
- Long-term position trading
- Portfolio rebalancing strategies
- Educational purposes for new traders

**Implementation Example:**
```python
ema_strategy = EMACrossoverStrategy(
    fast_period=5,   # Very responsive
    slow_period=13   # Golden ratio based
)
```

## Advanced Strategies

### Advanced Grid Strategy

**Overview:**
The Advanced Grid Strategy places multiple buy and sell orders at predetermined intervals above and below the current price, creating a "grid" of orders that profit from market volatility.

**How It Works:**

    safety_orders=7,
    dynamic_adjustment=True,
    volatility_threshold=0.03
)
```
