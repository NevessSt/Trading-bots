## Production Tips

### Recording
- Use screen recording software with audio capture
- Ensure your desktop is clean and professional
- Close unnecessary applications and notifications
- Use a quality microphone for clear audio
- Record in a quiet environment

### Narration
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use professional, confident tone

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too long**: Viewers lose interest after 5 minutes
- **Poor audio**: Bad sound quality undermines professionalism

- **Lack of structure**: Random demonstrations without clear organization
- **No call to action**: Failing to tell viewers what to do next
