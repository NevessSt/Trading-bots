# Main Package Preparation Guide

## Introduction

Your main package is the core deliverable that customers will download after purchasing your plugin. This guide provides instructions for organizing and preparing a professional, user-friendly package that meets marketplace standards.

## Package Structure

Organize your main package with the following structure:

```
main_package/
├── README.md                 # Quick start guide and overview
├── CHANGELOG.md              # Version history and updates
├── LICENSE.md                # License information
├── your_plugin_name/         # Main plugin directory
│   ├── core/                 # Core functionality
│   ├── indicators/           # Trading indicators
│   ├── utils/                # Utility functions
│   └── ui/                   # User interface components
├── examples/                 # Example configurations and usage
├── tests/                    # Test files (if included)
└── documentation/            # Comprehensive documentation
    ├── installation.md       # Installation instructions
    ├── configuration.md      # Configuration options
    ├── usage.md              # Usage instructions
    ├── api_reference.md      # API documentation if applicable
    └── troubleshooting.md    # Common issues and solutions
```

## Essential Components

### 1. README.md

Your README should provide a quick overview and getting started guide:

- Plugin name and version
- Brief description of functionality
- Key features list
- Quick installation steps
- Basic usage example
- Requirements and dependencies
- Link to full documentation
- Support contact information

### 2. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for user satisfaction:

- **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Configuration Guide**: All available options and their effects
- **Usage Guide**: How to use the plugin effectively
- **API Reference**: If your plugin has an API
- **Troubleshooting**: Solutions to common problems
- **Examples**: Real-world usage scenarios

### 3. Code Organization

Ensure your code is well-organized and follows best practices:

- Clear directory structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive comments
- Separation of concerns
- Proper error handling
- Configuration options in designated files

## Preparation Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] Remove all debug code and comments
- [ ] Run code through formatter (`code_formatter.py`)
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify compatibility with specified platforms
- [ ] Optimize performance where possible

### Documentation Quality

- [ ] Proofread all documentation for errors
- [ ] Ensure documentation matches actual functionality
- [ ] Include screenshots where helpful
- [ ] Provide code examples for key features
- [ ] Check links for accuracy
- [ ] Format documentation consistently

### Package Integrity

- [ ] Include all required dependencies
- [ ] Verify no unnecessary files are included
- [ ] Check file permissions are appropriate
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive information is included
- [ ] Verify package size is reasonable
- [ ] Test installation process on a clean environment

## File Formats and Naming

### Main Package

- **Format**: ZIP file
- **Naming**: `plugin_name_vX.Y.Z.zip` (include version number)
- **Size**: Keep under 50MB if possible

### Documentation

- **Format**: Markdown (.md) for text documentation
- **Images**: Include in documentation/images/ folder
- **Diagrams**: SVG format preferred for diagrams

## Version Control

- Include version number in:
  - README.md
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - Main plugin file headers
  - Package filename

- Follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z):
  - X: Major version (breaking changes)
  - Y: Minor version (new features, non-breaking)
  - Z: Patch version (bug fixes)

## Legal Requirements

- Include license information
- Attribute third-party libraries appropriately
- Include privacy policy if collecting user data
- Ensure compliance with marketplace terms

## Testing Before Submission

1. Install your package in a clean environment
2. Follow your own installation instructions
3. Test all features as described in documentation
4. Verify examples work as expected
5. Check for any platform-specific issues

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Missing dependencies or requirements
- Hardcoded paths or user-specific configurations
- Outdated or inaccurate documentation
- Inconsistent versioning across files
- Including unnecessary temporary or build files
- Overly complex installation process
- Insufficient error handling or user feedback
