## Pricing Strategies

### Value-Based Pricing

**Approach:** Price based on the value your plugin delivers to customers.

**Implementation:**
1. Quantify the financial benefit your plugin provides
2. Determine what percentage of that benefit is a fair price
3. Consider the risk reduction value
4. Factor in time savings and convenience

**Example Calculation:**
- If your plugin saves 10 hours/month at $50/hour = $500 value
- If it improves returns by 2% on $10,000 = $200 value
- Total monthly value = $700
- Price at 10-30% of value = $70-$210/month

### Cost-Plus Pricing

**Approach:** Calculate your costs and add a profit margin.

**Implementation:**
1. Calculate development costs (time × hourly rate)
2. Add ongoing costs (hosting, support, updates)
3. Determine target sales volume
4. Add desired profit margin

**Example Calculation:**
- Development: 200 hours × $50/hour = $10,000
- Annual maintenance: 50 hours × $50/hour = $2,500
- Target sales: 100 units
- Cost per unit: ($10,000 + $2,500) ÷ 100 = $125
- With 100% margin = $250 price

### Market-Based Pricing

**Approach:** Set prices based on competitive landscape.

**Implementation:**
1. Identify average price in your category
2. Adjust based on your relative quality/features
3. Consider your market positioning (premium vs. value)
4. Factor in your brand strength

**Positioning Options:**
- Premium (10-30% above average): For superior quality/features
- Competitive (±10% of average): For similar quality/features
- Value (10-30% below average): For newer entrants or simpler tools
