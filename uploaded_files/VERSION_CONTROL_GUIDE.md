# Version Control and Update Management Guide

## Introduction

Effective version control and update management are essential for maintaining high-quality trading plugins. This guide outlines best practices for implementing a robust versioning system, managing updates, and communicating changes to users.

## Version Numbering System

### Semantic Versioning

1. **Structure: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**
   - **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
   - **MINOR**: New functionality (backward compatible)
   - **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
   - Example: 2.4.1

2. **Pre-release Identifiers**
   - Alpha: Early testing (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1)
   - Beta: Feature complete, possible bugs (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.2)
   - RC: Release candidates (e.g., 1.0.0-rc.1)
