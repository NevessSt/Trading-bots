│   ├── your_plugin_files/

│   └── README.md

└── video/
    └── demo_video_link.txt
```

## Image Requirements

### Preview Image (1600×800)

The preview image is the first thing potential buyers see. It should:

- Clearly represent your plugin's purpose and main features
- Include your plugin name and a brief tagline
- Use professional design elements consistent with your branding
- Avoid cluttered layouts or excessive text
- Be saved in PNG or JPG format with high quality

### Icon Image (200×200)

Your icon represents your plugin in search results and listings. It should:

- Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use consistent branding with your other materials
- Have a transparent background (PNG format)
- Avoid tiny text that will be illegible at small sizes
- Stand out visually among other marketplace icons

### Screenshots (Minimum 3, Maximum 8)

Screenshots demonstrate your plugin's functionality. They should:

- Show different aspects of your plugin in action
- Include captions explaining what is being shown
- Be taken at high resolution with clear visibility
- Demonstrate real use cases, not just setup screens
- Be consistent in size and style

## Video Guidelines

A demonstration video significantly increases conversion rates. Your video should:

- Be 2-5 minutes in length
- Start with a brief overview of what the plugin does
- Demonstrate key features in action
- Show actual trading scenarios where applicable
- Have clear, professional narration
- End with a call to action

## Submission Package

When ready to submit:

1. Create a ZIP file of your main plugin package
2. Create a separate ZIP file containing your screenshots
3. Upload your preview and icon images separately
4. Provide a YouTube URL for your demonstration video
