### Recording

1. **Screen Recording**

   - Consider recording system audio separately

2. **Narration**
   - Use a quality microphone
   - Record in a quiet environment
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace

3. **Mouse Movements**
   - Move cursor deliberately and smoothly
   - Highlight important elements
   - Use zoom/highlight features for small details

### Post-Production

1. **Editing**
   - Remove mistakes and long pauses
   - Add transitions between sections
   - Include text overlays for key points
   - Add intro/outro screens

2. **Enhancements**

   - Include captions for accessibility
   - Add your logo/branding (subtle)

3. **Final Review**
   - Check audio/video synchronization
   - Ensure all sensitive information is removed
   - Verify all features are clearly demonstrated

- **Focus on benefits** - Explain how features solve problems
